    <h2>FERPA Essentials for Faculty: FAQs</h2>

    <h3>1. What is FERPA?</h3>
    <p>
        FERPA stands for the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Enacted in 1974, it's a federal law designed to protect the privacy of student education records. Essentially, it gives students control over who has access to their academic and personal information. All institutions receiving funding from the U.S. Department of Education, including our university, must comply with FERPA regulations.
    </p>

    <h3>2. What are the key student rights under FERPA?</h3>
    <p>
        FERPA grants students three primary rights:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Right to Inspect and Review:</strong> Students can request to see their education records and can request corrections if they find any inaccuracies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Right to Control Disclosures:</strong> Students have the right to decide who sees their information. Schools must obtain written consent from the student before disclosing any personally identifiable information, unless a specific legal exception applies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Right to Request Amendment:</strong> If a student believes their education record contains misleading or inaccurate information, they can formally request an amendment.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. What constitutes an "education record" under FERPA?</h3>
    <p>
        An education record encompasses any information directly related to a student that is maintained by the institution. This includes, but is not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transcripts</li>
        <li>Advising notes</li>
        <li>Email correspondence about the student</li>
        <li>Graded assignments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Can I discuss a student's performance with their parents?</h3>
    <p>
        No, you cannot share a student's educational information with their parents without the student's explicit written consent, even if the student is financially dependent on their parents. This includes grades, academic standing, and any disciplinary actions. The only exception is if the student has signed a FERPA release form specifically authorizing you to speak with their parents.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Can I share student information with other faculty members?</h3>
    <p>
        You can share student information with colleagues only if they have a legitimate educational interest. This means they need the information to fulfill their job responsibilities, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Teaching a course the student is enrolled in.</li>
        <li>Advising the student.</li>
        <li>Participating in a disciplinary committee related to the student.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Avoid casual conversations about a student's grades or academic progress that don't serve a direct educational purpose.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Are there special FERPA considerations when using technology?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, it's crucial to be mindful of FERPA compliance in the digital age. Here are some key points to remember:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Learning Management Systems (LMS):</strong> Only use university-approved LMS platforms (like Blackboard or Canvas) and be cautious when integrating third-party tools or apps.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Email:</strong> Use your official university email address when communicating with students about their academic performance. Never email sensitive student data using personal email accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Avoid storing any sensitive student data on non-university approved cloud services like Google Drive or Dropbox unless the information is encrypted and meets university security standards.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. What are the consequences of a FERPA violation?</h3>
    <p>
        FERPA violations can have serious consequences for the institution, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Loss of federal funding</li>
        <li>Lawsuits</li>
        <li>Damage to the institution's reputation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While individual faculty members are not typically subject to personal fines, FERPA violations can reflect poorly on your professional standing.
    </p>

    <h3>8. What should I do if I am unsure about FERPA compliance?</h3>
    <p>
        If you are ever in doubt about handling student records or have questions about FERPA compliance, it's essential to reach out to the appropriate resources:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contact your Registrar's Office</li>
        <li>Consult with the university's designated FERPA compliance officer</li>
    </ul>
